# 7: Our first ever guest, designing remotely

While Kevin takes the afternoon off for some well-deserved [family and petting zoo time][pz], we’re joined by our guest [Karsten Rowe][kr]. Karsten is a UK-based designer, and together with Andrew and Chris he chats about remote work, jumping from graphic to product design, and how one grows and becomes inspired.

*Note:* Andrew apologizes for the episode’s poor audio quality. This is the first episode we’ve recorded in-person.
