# Code Optional: A podcast about the trials and tribulations of building software

Three engineering comrades – Andrew Sardone, Kevin Vitale, and Chris Dzombak – talk about development, design, and shipping apps. There’s a heavy slant towards Apple tech, balanced with general inquiries around programming and the intricacies/inanities of software.
